A Hinjewadi product manager, a Koregaon Park café regular, and a Pimpri-Chinchwad plant manager all use social media differently — and TML builds strategies that account for these differences.",

For consumer brands, Instagram reels and YouTube Shorts dominate, with content designed for Pune's quality-conscious audience.",
